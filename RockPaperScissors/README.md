Using a web browser, go to [https://create.withcode.uk](https://create.withcode.uk/)

For this workshop, we will be coding inside this editor, which includes
a micro:bit simulator so you can preview the results while you are working.

**More Python Editors**

Since this project was created back in 2017, other fine Python editors have become available.

[micro:bit Python Editor v2](https://python.microbit.org/v/2.0) - Google Chrome web browser based editor, uses WebUSB to transfer code to the micro:bit.

[Code with Mu](https://codewith.mu) - a simple Python editor that can be installed on Mac, Windows and Linux (including the Raspberry Pi).
