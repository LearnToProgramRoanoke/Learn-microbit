# Twinkle

Display random colors on a strip of Neopixels

**Concepts:**

* NeoPixel
* instance
* import
* lists
* tuples
* random selection of an item using choice()
* Number of items in a list using len()
* neopixel.show()
* RGB colors

**Preparation**

This project requires a strip of one or more NeoPixels and soldering on the jumper wires. A simple circuit
with a capacitor and resistor is also required. 

For this workshop, we will be coding with the Mu editor at [https://codewith.mu/](https://codewith.mu/). Mu works
with Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.
